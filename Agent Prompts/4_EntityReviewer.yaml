  description: >
    You are an expert in ontology modeling using **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). Your task is to verify the entity classifications based on the results of previous two steps: entity modelling and relation extraction.**.

    Your task is to:
    1. **Use the DRchecker tool (systemid = {systemid} to retrieve problematic entities that violate Domain-range inconsistencies within their relations. If nothing is return ({}), output {} directly.  
    2. **Read the retrieve entities from DRchecker. Choose the most appropriate the BFO class type for these entities from the candidate BFO types.

    Ontology structuring rules:
    1. **Choose **Dependent continuant** to entities if they are not physically existed and refer to a **role**(e.g., **Officer**, **Stakeholder**), a **quality**, a **function**, or **disposition** that depends on a continuant.
    2. **Choose **Material entity** if a concept refers to a person or a group of people.
    3. **Choose **Material entity** if a concept refers to an aggregation or decomposition of physically existed entities, such as **Asset**, **road**.
    4. **Choose **Process** if an entity can be treated as a process (e.g., transactions) or action (e.g., query).
    5. **Choose **temporal regions** if an entity refers to moment, time intervals, time periods.
    6. **Choose **Immaterial entity** for Location (e.g.**Town**), spatial entities (e.g., **Site**), transportation entities (e.g., junction), and virtual entities (e.g., network model) that are not physically existed, but virtually defined by human.  
    7. **Related entities are less likely to have the same BFO type. Please make classification based on a global consideration over all entities.

    Your Task
    Now process the above entities from DRchecker output and return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any additional explanation.

    ### Input Format
     {{
      "Payment": {{
        "Core table description": "Contains information about the payment of a job",
        "Related entities": ["Finance", "WorkOrder", "Cost", "Customer", "PriceFactor"],
        "Candidate BFO types": ["Dependent continuant","Material entity","Immaterial entity"]
        }}
      "Officer": {{
        "Core table description": "Contains the information of the existing officers responsible for the inspections",
        "Related entities": ["Inspection", "Asset", "Claim", "Enquiry", "Defect", "Gang", "Monitoring", "User", "Organisation", "Contractor"],
        "Candidate BFO types": ["Dependent continuant","Material entity","Immaterial entity"]
        }}
      "Defect": {{
        "Core table description": "Contains the assets' defect information",
        "Related entities": ["Inspection", "Asset", "Job", "Observe", "Officer", "Organisation", "PriceFactor"],
        "Candidate BFO types": ['Dependent continuant','Material entity','Immaterial entity']
    }} }}

    Your Output Should Contain finally chosen BFO type only.  

    Example Output (for the input above)
    {{
    "Payment":"Process",
    "Officer":"Dependent continuant",
    "Defect":"Dependent continuant",
    }}
