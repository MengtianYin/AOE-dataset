Subrelationreview_task:
  description: |
    You are an expert in road asset data ontology modeling based on **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**. Your task is to resolve conflicts on  sub-relations that are subtypes of different BFO relations.
    
    ### **Ontology Structuring Rules**
    1. **For triples to be revised, please consider existing sub-relations under its specific BFO relation. If no existing sub-relation is suitable, create a new sub-relation.   
    2. **Do not generate a new sub-relation that is subtype of different BFO relations. For example, don't generate 'managed by' as subtype of both 'depends on' and 'depends on by'. Use other descriptions, such as 'manages'.
    3. **Generate a sub-relation that appropriately describes the semantic relationships between two concepts. Consider the system description to infer semantic relaitonships. 
    4. **Generate inverse relations for two triples that are in reversed order. Do not generate the same relations. For example, generate relations like: Job - specificied by -contract and contract - specifies -Job. Enquiry - is about - Site, Site - relates to - Site.  
    5. **Generate a sub-relation that is semantically coherant to its parent BFO relation. For example, generate sub-relation 'specified by' for ['Job', 'Contract', 'realizes'], where 'specified by' is subtype of "realizes".
    6. **Do NOT generate the same sub-relation that is subtype of differnt BFO relations.
    7. View existing sub-relation types and their parent BFO relations. Do NOT generate a sub-relation that conflicts with existing relations.

    Your Task
    Now, process the following triples.
    {inputs}
    
    Return ONLY a valid JSON object in a format of given output examples.
  expected_output: |
    **Input:**  
    You are given a list of problematic sub-relations like the example inputs below.
    [{{
    "Problematic relation":"associated with",
    "BFO relations": ['depends on', 'occupies temporal region', 'depends on by', 'realizes', 'has participant'] 
    "related triples":"[['Defect', 'Asset', 'depends on'],['Job', 'Contract', 'realizes'],['Job', 'Cost', 'has participant'],['Asset', 'SmartAttribute', 'depends on by']]
    }},
    {{
    "Problematic relation":"located in",
    "BFO relations": ['depends on', 'located in']
    "related triples":['Enquiry', 'Site', 'depends on'], ['Asset', 'Site', 'located in']
    }},
    {{
    "Problematic relation":"",
    "BFO relations": ['depends on', 'participates in']
    "related triples":['Cost', 'Asset', 'depends on'], ['Asset', 'Job', 'participates in']
    }}
    ]
    
    **Output:**  
    Output a list of JSON object following the format of the below examples.
    [{{
    "Summary": "'associated with' is more close to 'depends on', so triples involve 'occupies temporal region', 'depends on by', 'realizes', 'has participant' are revised.",
    "Revised triples":
    [
      ["Job','specified by", "Contract"],["Job", "incurs", "Cost"],["Asset", "has smart attribute", "SmartAttribute"]
    ]
    }},
    {{
    "Summary": "'located in' is an exact match of 'located in', so triples involve 'depends on' are revised.",
    "Revised triples":
    [
      ["Enquiry","is about", "Site"]
    ]
    }},
    {{
    "Summary": no sub-relation is specified, so all triples are given new sub-relations."
    "Revised triples":
    [
      ['Cost', 'related to', 'Asset'], ["Asset", "involved in", "Job"]
    ]
    }}
    ]
