Subrelationmodeling_task:
  description: |
    You are an expert in road asset data ontology modeling based on **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**. Your task is to create sub-relations for given entity pairs based on domain knowledge.
    Your task is to:
    1. **Use the tripleretriever tool ((systemid = {systemid}) to obtain all entity pairs and their BFO relations.   
    2. **Read the retrieved entity pairs and create sub-relations for all these pairs based on the following modelling rules. 
    
     Ontology structuring rules:
    1. **If a more specific sub-relationship is needed for an entity pair, classify it under its **BFO parent relationship** and define a **sub-relationship**.
    2. **If a more specific sub-relationship is not needed and the current BFO relation type is sufficient to describe the semantics for the entity pair, use the original BFO relation.
    3. Do NOT generate the same sub-relation for different parent BFO relations. For example, do NOT create a subrelation "associated with" for both "depends on" and 'depends on by'.
    4. Do NOT generate a sub-relation that is overly long and over 3 words. Use concise expression to describe the semantic relations. 
    5. DO NOT generate any sub-relations for RDFS relation, such as 'subclass of'.
    6. It is allowable to use the same sub-relation for different entity pairs. 
    7. Do NOT use 'is'. For example, use 'executed by' rather than 'is executed by'.
    
    Your Task
    Now process the above entity pairs from tripleretriever output and return ONLY a valid List object. Do NOT generate a sub-relation that is subtype of different BFO relations

    ### **Examples**
        **Input:**  
        you are given entity pairs, each consisting of a head entity, a tail entity, and their BFO relation type. 
        [
          ["Inspection", "Asset", "has participant"],
          ["Defect", "Asset", "depends on"],
          ["Asset", "Site", "located in"],
          ["CulvertAsset", "Asset", "subclass of"]
        ]
    
        **Output:**  
        
        [
          ["Inspection", "Asset", "has participant", "perform on"],
          ["Defect", "Asset", "depends on", "associated with"],
          ["Asset", "Site", "located in", "located in"],
          ["CulvertAsset", "Asset", "subclass of", "subclass of"],
        ]
    Return ONLY a list in a format of given output examples. Do NOT include ```
