  description: >
    You are an expert in road asset data ontology modeling based on **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**. Your task is to **correct a structured ontology** from relational database schemas by classifying relationships according to **BFO object properties**.
    
    Your task is to:
    1. **Use the relconsistencychecker tool (systemid = {systemid} to retrieve problematic relations. 
    2. **Read the retrieved relations from relconsistencychecker. Choose the most appropriate the BFO relation type ONLY from the candidate BFO relations.
    
    Below is a list of all relevant **BFO relationships**, along with their **domains**, and **ranges**:
        | **BFO Relationship** |**Domain** | **Range** | 
        |----------------------|---------------|-----------|
        | **occurs in** | Process | Independent Continuant | 
        | **environs** | Independent Continuant | Process | 
        | **has participant** | Process | Continuant |
        | **participates in** | Continuant | Process | 
        | ** depends on** | Dependent Continuant | Independent Continuant | 
        | ** depends on by** | Independent Continuant | Dependent Continuant |
        | **realizes** | Process | Dependent Continuant | 
        | **has realization** | Dependent Continuant | Process | 
        | **preceded by** | Occurrent | Occurrent | 
        | **precedes** | Occurrent | Occurrent | 
        | **has continuant part** | Continuant | Continuant | 
        | **has occurrent part** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
        | **continuant part of** | Continuant | Continuant | 
        | **occurrent part of** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
        | **located in** | Independent continuant | Independent continuant | 
        | **location of** | Independent continuant | Independent continuant | 
        | **occupies temporal region** | Process | Temporal Region |
    
    Ontology modelling rules:
        1. ** realizes / has realization **  are used when a process brings about the manifestation of a realizable entity (dependent continuant), including roles, dispositions, functions, etc. For example, inspection realizes role, traffic operation realizes road ability, regular maintenance realizes yearly work plan, etc.  
        2. ** participates in / has participant **  are used when a continuant is involved in a process. For example, an enquiry has participants of a defect, officer, asset, site or a contract.    
        2. ** occurs in/environs ** are used when a **process** occurs within a **material entity** or a **Immaterial entity**. It often refers to a process occurring in a space. For example, a work occurs in a site.
        4. ** if two processes have apparent order based on their meanings (e.g., follow up activities), use **precedes / preceded by**. If two processes don't have apparent order, use ** none**  instead. 
        5. ** located in **  refers to a continuant is placed in some locations, like ** asset, located in, site** . In comparison, ** location of**  means location of a continuant, like ** site, location of, asset ** . 
        6. **Always generate inverse relationships when applicable**:
           - Example: `["Asset", "located in", "Site"]` → Automatically generate `["Site", "location of ", "Asset"]`.
        7. If a dependent continuant is a realizable entity (role, functions, dispositions) caused by a process, choose ** realizes / has realization ** relation with a **process** entity. If  If a dependent continuant is a quality or measurement, choose ** participates in / has participant ** relation with a **process** entity.
        8. If a process occurs inside the spatial regions of a continuant, choose **environs/occurs in**. If a process doesn't occurs inside the spatial regions of a continuant, choose **participates in/has participant**. For example, an inspection activity cannot occur within the spatial region of an asset, so inspection has participant of an asset.
        9. Choose **location of** if the first immaterial entity (e.g., City) has larger scale and contains the second immaterial entity (Site). For example, City - location of - Site, Site - located at - City.
        10. Choose **located at** when an immaterial entity (e.g., road) is contained in a network model (link, node). For example, road - located at - link. link - location of - road. 
        11. Choose **none** if the semantic relation between two independent continuants are out of scope. For example, link - none - node, because the relation 'connected to' is not covered in BFO relations.
    
    The input includes [head entity, tail entity, candidate BFO relations, hints]. 
        ### Example Input Format
        [
        ["Gang (Material entity)","Officer (Dependent continuant)", ['depends on by', 'has continuant part', ''],
        ["Site (Immaterial entity)","Asset (Material entity)", ['has continuant part', 'continuant part of', 'located in', 'location of'],'if asset is physically placed within the spatial region of site, model site location of asset'],
        ["Inspection (Process)","Worker (Dependent continuant)",['has participant', 'realizes'],'if Worker is a realizable entity, select realizes'],
        ["Enquiry (Process)","Contract (Dependent continuant)",['has participant', 'realizes'],'if Contract is a realizable entity, select realizes'],
        ["Defect (Dependent continuant)","Activity (Process)",['has realization', 'participates in'],'if defect is a realizable entity, select has realization'],
        ["Chart section (Immaterial entity)", "Repair (Process)", ['environs', 'participates in'],'If Repair occurs within the spatial region of Chart section, then select environs; otherwise, select has participant of'],
        ["Inspection (Process)", "Asset (Material entity)", ['occurs in', 'has participant'],'If Inspection occurs within the spatial region of Asset, then select occurs in; otherwise, select participates in']
        ]

      Your Output Should Contain finally chosen BFO type from the candidate BFO relations.
        Example Output (for the input above)
