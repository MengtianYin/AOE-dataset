    ### **Task**
    1. Execute the relationdiscovery tool with systemid {systemid} and entities: {entities} to extract entity‐pairs.
  
    2. Predict semantic relations for these entity pairs based on the below classifications.
    
    ## **Full List of BFO Object Properties**

    Below is a list of all relevant **BFO relationships**, along with their **domains**, and **ranges**:

    | **BFO Relationship** |**Domain** | **Range** |
    |----------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
    | **occurs in** | Process | Independent Continuant |
    | **environs** | Independent Continuant | Process |
    | **has participant** | Process | Continuant |
    | **participates in** | Continuant | Process |
    | ** depends on** | Dependent Continuant | Independent Continuant |
    | ** depends on by** | Independent Continuant | Dependent Continuant |
    | **realizes** | Process | Dependent Continuant |
    | **has realization** | Dependent Continuant | Process |
    | **preceded by** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
    | **precedes** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
    | **has continuant part** | Continuant | Continuant |
    | **has occurrent part** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
    | **continuant part of** | Continuant | Continuant |
    | **occurrent part of** | Occurrent | Occurrent |
    | **located in** | Independent continuant | Independent continuant |
    | **location of** | Independent continuant | Independent continuant |
    | **occupies temporal region** | Process | Temporal Region |

    ## Other basic relations: **subclass of**, **parent class of**
    
    ### **Ontology Structuring Rules**
        1. **Classify the semantic relationship between Entity1 and Entity2 using BFO relationships**:
          - If a more specific relationship is needed, classify it under a **BFO parent relationship**.
          - If an entity is simply a subclass/parent class of the other entity, don't use BFO relationships.
        2. **Use the following format for relationship classification**:
          - **Example 1 (Sub-relationship needed)**:
                        `("Inspection", "Asset") → BFO classification:occurs in
          - **Example 2 (No sub-relationship needed)**:
                        `("Asset", "Site") → BFO classification: located in
        3. **When generating relationships, consider**:
          - The semantic meaning of both entities.
          - Existing domain knowledge in road asset management.
          - Domain and range restrictions. For example, if **contract** is a dependent continuant, then its relation with **asset** cannot be **has participant** because the domain of **has participant** is **process**.
          - In BFO, process and temporal region are subclasses of occurrent; material entity, immaterial entity are subclasses of independent continuant; independent continuant and dependent continuant are subclasses of continunant.
        4. **Always generate inverse relationships when applicable**:
          - Example: `[ "Asset", "located in", "Site" ]` → Automatically generate `["Site", "location of ", "Asset"]`.
        5. **If one entity is a general concept (e.g., **Asset**) and the other entity is a specific subtype (e.g., **Pavement**), choose **parent class of** or **subclass of**.

    ### **Examples**
    **Input:**  
    [
      ["Inspection", "Asset"],
      ["Defect", "Asset"],
      ["Asset", "Site"],
      ["Cost", "Activity"],
      ["Asset", "Pavement"]
      ["Soakaway", "Drainage"]
    ]
    **Output:**  
    [
      ["Inspection", "Asset", "occurs in"],
      ["Defect", "Asset", "depends on"],
      ["Asset", "Site", "located in"],
      ["Cost", "Activity","has realization"],
      ["Asset", "Pavement","parent class of"],
      ["Soakaway", "Drainage","subclass of"]
    ]
    
    Now, for the above entity pairs from executed tool, classify the relationships according to BFO object properties.
